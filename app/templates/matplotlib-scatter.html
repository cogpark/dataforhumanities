        <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Scatter plots are useful for seeing if there's a relationship between two variables. The idea is, you graph one against another,
                    and you can see if an increase in one is mirrored by an increase in another, if one decreases when the other increases, or if
                    there's no apparent relationship. </p><br>

                <p>Here's how you make a basic scatter plot in using the Python3 library, matplotlib.</p>

        <h2>Setup</h2>
                <p>You'll need Matplotlib installed. You will almost certainly want Pandas, another Python library, too. If
                    <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">you have Anaconda installed</a>, you're already set. You can also install
                    each&#8212;<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html">Pandas</a> and
                    <a href="https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html">Matplotlib</a>&#8212; individually.</p> <br>

                <p>Finally, you'll need somewhere to visualize your plot. A great place to begin is with
                    <a href="https://jupyter.org/install">Jupyter Notebooks, which is what I'll be using here./a></p><br>

                <p>You'll also need data. I'll show you how to do this with fake data and with data you import from a csv. </p>

        <h2>A quick, basic scatter</h2>
            <p>Here are the basic building blocks of a scatter plot:</p>
             <div class= "codeblock">
                <pre>
                # You'll see Matplotlib.pyplot abbreviated as plt and pp
                import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

                # Here's some data
                x = [1,3,19,3,12,15,25,43,3,13,19,12]
                y = [2,25,24,35,18,34,7,10,23,21,1,8]

                # feed x and y into a scatter plot
                plt.scatter(x,y)

                # give it a title
                plt.title('A very basic scatterplot')

                # draw it
                plt.show()
                </pre></div>
            <p>That generates the following scatter plot:</p>
            <img src="../static/img/scatter-basic">
            <p>This is missing all sorts of things you'll eventually want&#8212;axis titles, a bigger chart, nice colors&#8212; but it also
                illustrates the 4 basic things you'll do when you generate scatterplots using Matplotlib.pyplot:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Load data into your environment (e.g. your Jupyter Notebook)</li>
                <li>Get data into the correct format for scatter plotting </li>
                <li>Load the data into your chart</li>
                <li>Style the chart</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Scatterplotting data that you load from a CSV</h2>
            <p>A lot of data you work with will be in .csv or .txt format. Fortunately, Pandas has a <code>read_csv()</code>function that can help.
                For this example, I'll use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset">a dataset on London
                    bike sharing</a>I downloaded from Kaggle.</p>
            <div class= "codeblock">
            <pre>
            # You'll almost always see Pandas abbreviated as pd
            import pandas as pd

            # import data using the Pandas read_csv() function and assign the results to a variable
            df = pd.read_csv('path_to/your/data_set.csv')

            # Show the first 5 rows so that you can get a sense of what the data's like
            df.head()
            </pre></div>
            <p><code>pd.read_csv</code> results in a <em>dataframe</em>. A simple definition of a dataframe is that it's a table. A slightly less
                simple definition is that it is a 2-dimensional data structure with one or more columns. We can do all sorts of
                interesting things using dataframes, and it's a concept common to other languages&#8212;so it's worth your time to become
                acquainted with them.</p><br>
            <p>When you're lucky, converting a csv or text file is as simple as the lines above. However, sometimes the file isn't in the exact
                format you'd like. (This is one reason to run <code>df.head()</code>; it lets you see if there is obvious maintenance to be done.)
                We're not going to go into Stuff You Might Need To Troubleshoot here, or we'd never get to the scatterplotting, but be aware that
                It Is A Thing.</p><br>

        <h3>Set up your X and Y variables</h3>
            <p>A basic scatter plot maps the data from one variable&#8212;i.e. one column&#8212;against another. Typically,
            the Y axis is the dependent variable, or the variable you are trying to study. So, for this exercise, I want to ask
            my data if the number of bikes rented (my dependent variable) goes up or down depending on
            how windy it is (my independent variable).</p><br>
            <p>First, I extract just the number of bikes rented and the windspeed from my data set and assign them to
            variables:</p>
            <div class= "codeblock">
            <pre>
            x = df['wind_speed']
            y = df['cnt']
            </pre></div>
            <p>At this point, I have the series I'm interested in stored in my x and y variables, and I could
            generate a scatterplot with the same code I used above, but it's not very useful or pretty. There's
            too much data and the chart is too small to really see a pattern.</p>
            <img src="not useful scatter">
            <p>So, next, let's improve the scatterplot to see if we can get a clearer sense of the relationship
            (if one exists).</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b>One key skill you'll want to learn is how to filter and group your data so that you can be more selective with what you're
                plotting. Unfortunately, that too, is a big enough topic to be a post for another time.</p>

         <h2>Set up your matplotlib figure</h2>
            <p>Matplotlib is a very, very large library, and there's more than one way to do almost everything.
            But this section describes the method I see most often, and is flexible enough that it should
            meet most basic plotting needs.</p>
