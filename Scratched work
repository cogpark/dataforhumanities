 <h3>Multiple join conditions</h3>
  Sometimes, you need to join on multiple columns. This happens a lot when you have a "time" column in a table. If we imagine that
our <code>DOGS</code> table above had number of words by month, then joining on the dog's name is going to return one record for each month
that you've worked with the dog. For example, here's an example using George, a very good and smart boy:

  <div class= "codeblock">
    <pre>
      DOGS (without month)
          dog_name |  age  |      breed      | words_learned
      -------------+-------+-----------------+--------------
      | George     |   3   |aussie shepherd  |      149
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class= "codeblock">
  <pre>
    DOGS (with month)
        dog_name |  age  |      breed      | words_learned |  month
    -------------+-------+-----------------+---------------+ ------
    | George     |   3   |aussie shepherd  |      50       |  Jan
    | George     |   3   |aussie shepherd  |      43       |  Feb
    | George     |   3   |aussie shepherd  |      56       |  March
  </pre>
</div>
  <p>Nice job in March, George. Anyway, if you only wanted to get 1 record back for George -- maybe you're about to send out your March
    postcard -- you would need to join on <code>dog_name</code> and <code>month</code>. All you have to do is append an add an <code>AND</code> clause to the
    <code>JOIN</code>query.
  </p>.
